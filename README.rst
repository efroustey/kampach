Kampach: computes the energetic cost of archelogical sites
==========================================================

Kampach is a Python package to create models of archeological sites
that allow to compute the energetic cost of their construction.
It is based on the description of buildings geometric shapes and
of activities required for their construction.

It provides a BoundedQuantity object based on Pint's Quantity class,
that allows the manipulation of physical quantities with incertitude
bounds that are propagated in all the computations.

Kampach relies on a modified version of Pint that is available at
